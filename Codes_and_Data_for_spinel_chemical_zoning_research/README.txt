In order to run the codes properly, please do not modify the orignal data files (csv files).

The tree structure constructed by Decision tree algorithm can be produced by using 'Decision tree.ipynb'
The feature importance estimated by Random Forest algorithm can be calulated by using 'Random Forest.ipynb'
The probability maps constructed by Logestic Regression algorithm can be made by using 'Probability map for Aver_delta and R.ipynb', 
'Probability map for Aver_delta and L.ipynb', and 'Probability map for R and L.ipynb'

Need python environment (Jupyter Notebook) and matplotlib and pandas and scikit-learn libraries to safely run the files.
