The 'README' file  contains detailed information about the included datasets and the script. 


1. 'Research_papers': This file contains my published papers, which are 'Relationships between intensity of deformation induced 
Cr–Al chemical zoning and geometrical properties of spinel: An approach applying machine learning analyses.' and 'A shape-change model 
for isolated K-feldspar inclusions within a shear zone developed in the Teshima granite, Ryoke metamorphic belt, Japan: Estimation of 
the duration of deformation in a natural shear zone.', and a preprinted paper, which is 'Relationships between fault friction, slip time, 
and physical parameters explored by experiment-based friction model: A Machine Learning Approach Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)'.

2. 'Codes_and_Data_for_fault_friction_research': This file contains data and script utilized in the preprinted research titled 'Relationships between fault friction, slip time, and 
physical parameters explored by experiment-based friction model: A Machine Learning Approach Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)'.

3. 'Codes_and_Data_for_spinel_chemical_zoning_research': This file comprises the data and scripts employed in the study 'Relationships between intensity 
of deformation induced Cr–Al chemical zoning and geometrical properties of spinel: An approach applying machine learning analyses.'.

4. 'Codes_for_Image_detection': This file encompasses a code script designed to build a model for image detection utilizing the Oxford Pet Dataset and Ultralytics YOLO v3.
 The script is specifically developed to train image detection methodologies for my next research project.

5. 'Codes_for_Research_applying_Transformer_Architecture': This file includes a code script designed to develop a model that predicts the future friction of 
experimental faults using the Transformers Architecture with mechanical data from experimental faults. As the manuscript for this research is currently 
in the process of being written, it has not been uploaded at this time.


We hope that these data and associated scripts provide a helpful resource for understanding my research and skill.
